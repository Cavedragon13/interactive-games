The impact has destroyed your mother ship and damaged most of your equipment. \n\n                    You and your crew are uninjured, but your survival depends on reaching the lunar base on foot. You must traverse the moon's harsh terrain with limited supplies. The lunar day will last approximately 14 Earth days, followed by 14 days of darkness. Surface temperatures range from 260¬∞F (127¬∞C) in sunlight to -280¬∞F (-173¬∞C) in shadow.\n\n                    Your space suits are intact with 72 hours of oxygen remaining. Below are 10 items that survived the crash intact. Your crew's survival depends on choosing the most critical items to carry on your 120-mile journey to safety.
