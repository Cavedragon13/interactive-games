                    Your group of eight hikers was relying entirely on smartphone GPS and had no backup navigation. The trail markers were removed for maintenance, and several connecting trails lead in different directions. A storm is approaching, and you must reach civilization before running out of food in 3 days.

                    Traditional navigation skills that humans used for thousands of years are now your only hope. You must choose the right tools and techniques to find your way out of the wilderness using methods your grandfather would recognize. Modern technology has become useless weight.`,

                    Your survival radio works, but rescue operations are impossible until you reach a designated pickup zone 60 miles away. Enemy forces control all roads and have set up checkpoints. Civilians may be hostile or helpful - you can't tell which.

                    You must evade capture while moving toward the pickup zone over 5-7 days. Being captured would compromise military intelligence and endanger your unit. Winter conditions make travel dangerous, but staying put risks discovery. You have 10 items from your survival kit.`,

You and four other crew members managed to hide in a sealed storage compartment during the initial attack.

                    The pirates control the bridge and engine room but haven't found your hiding place yet. You can hear them searching the ship and threatening the captured crew. International naval forces are en route, but rescue is 18-24 hours away.

                    Your hiding place has limited air circulation and no food or water. The pirates are becoming increasingly agitated as military ships approach. You must survive until rescue while avoiding detection, or attempt to help the captured crew. You have 10 items that were stored in your compartment.`,

                    emergencyScenario: `A massive wildfire is racing toward your mountain cabin community at 60 mph, driven by extreme winds. You have 30 minutes before the fire reaches your location. Evacuation routes are clogged with panicked residents and falling trees.

                    The fire has jumped the main highway, cutting off the primary escape route. Temperatures are reaching 2000¬∞F (1093¬∞C) at the fire line, and burning embers are raining down miles ahead of the main blaze. Your car's tires could melt on the superheated asphalt.

                    Thick smoke is reducing visibility to 10 feet, making driving nearly impossible. Several vehicles have crashed and are blocking roads. You must choose between attempting vehicle evacuation, sheltering in place, or trying escape on foot through the burning forest. You have 10 emergency items available.`,

                    The power grid has failed under the weight of ice and snow. Your home's heating system is down, and indoor temperature is dropping rapidly. Roads are completely impassable - even emergency vehicles can't move. The storm is forecast to continue for another 48 hours.

                    Several neighbors' houses have lost their roofs to snow load. Pipes are starting to freeze, and you can hear trees crashing down around the neighborhood. You must keep your family alive until rescue crews can reach you in 3-4 days when the storm passes.`,

                    emergencyScenario: `A coordinated cyber attack has crippled all critical infrastructure in your region. Power grids, water treatment, telecommunications, banking, and transportation systems have been compromised by malware. You're the emergency coordinator for a hospital that's operating on backup power.

                    Medical equipment is failing as networked systems crash. Patient records are encrypted by ransomware, and you can't access critical medical histories. The pharmacy can't process prescriptions, and laboratory equipment is offline. Emergency services can't communicate or coordinate responses.

                    Backup generators will run for 72 hours maximum. After that, life support systems will fail, putting dozens of critical patients at risk. You must maintain essential operations while coordinating with authorities to restore systems. You have 10 emergency response options available.`,

                    The avalanche beacon indicates at least three buried victims within 100 yards. Outside temperature is -10¬∞F (-23¬∞C) with more snow falling. Professional rescue teams are 45 minutes away due to continued avalanche danger.

                    Buried victims have only 15 minutes before survival chances drop dramatically. Your group must decide: attempt immediate rescue with limited equipment, wait for professionals, or secure your own survival first. Hypothermia is setting in, and more avalanches are possible. You have 10 emergency items available.`,

                    You and your crew are uninjured, but your survival depends on reaching the lunar base on foot. You must traverse the moon's harsh terrain with limited supplies. The lunar day will last approximately 14 Earth days, followed by 14 days of darkness. Surface temperatures range from 260¬∞F (127¬∞C) in sunlight to -280¬∞F (-173¬∞C) in shadow.

                    Your space suits are intact with 72 hours of oxygen remaining. Below are 10 items that survived the crash intact. Your crew's survival depends on choosing the most critical items to carry on your 120-mile journey to safety. Remember, every pound matters in the moon's low gravity, and you can only carry so much.`,

                    The crash site is in a narrow valley surrounded by peaks. The nearest town is 50 miles away, but you don't know in which direction. Night temperatures drop to -20¬∞F (-29¬∞C), and a storm system is approaching. Snow depth is already 2 feet with more expected.

                    You're dressed in business clothing suitable for city weather, not mountain survival. The plane's radio is destroyed, but the emergency beacon may be working. Search and rescue could take 2-7 days in these conditions. You've salvaged 10 items from the wreckage.`,

                    emergencyScenario: `Your military transport has crashed deep in the Amazon rainforest. The pilot is dead, and the radio is destroyed. You and four other survivors have minor injuries. You're at least 100 miles from any known settlement.

                    The jungle canopy is so thick that rescue aircraft will have extreme difficulty spotting you. Temperature is 95¬∞F (35¬∞C) with 98% humidity. Heavy rains occur daily, and the area is known for dangerous wildlife including jaguars, snakes, and poisonous insects.

                    Your uniforms are already soaked with sweat and rain. Every movement through the dense vegetation is exhausting. Rescue could take 7-14 days if your emergency beacon is working through the canopy. You've salvaged 10 items from the wreckage.`,

                    emergencyScenario: `Your asteroid mining station on Asteroid 2029-TX has suffered a catastrophic solar panel failure during a solar storm. Main power is offline, and you're operating on emergency batteries with 72 hours of power remaining. You and your crew of four are 2.5 AU from Earth.

                    The station is slowly losing pressure through micro-fractures. Internal temperature is dropping as heating systems fail. You're in zero gravity, and the asteroid's rotation is causing disorienting day/night cycles every 3 hours. Communication with Earth has a 25-minute delay each way.

                    A rescue ship was dispatched immediately but will take 7-10 days to reach you. Your survival depends on managing limited resources in the harsh environment of space. You have access to 10 emergency items from the mining station's supplies.`,

                    The storm system is still active with multiple tornadoes reported in the area. Emergency services are overwhelmed across three counties. You have limited air circulation, and the cellar is slowly flooding from broken water pipes.

                    Cell towers are down, but you can hear rescue teams searching through debris above. However, the gas leak makes it dangerous for them to use heavy equipment. You must signal your location while avoiding suffocation or explosion. You have 10 items salvaged before taking shelter.`,

                    emergencyScenario: `A magnitude 9.0 earthquake off the Alaskan coast has generated a massive tsunami heading toward the Pacific Northwest. You're at a beachfront resort when the warning sirens begin blaring. The first waves will arrive in 45 minutes.

                    The hotel is only 20 feet above sea level, and wave heights are predicted at 60+ feet. Thousands of tourists are panicking, and evacuation routes are already gridlocked. The ground is still shaking from aftershocks, making driving dangerous.

                    You can see the ocean receding dramatically - exposing the seafloor for hundreds of yards. This is the classic warning sign that massive waves are coming. Your group must decide: attempt evacuation by car, go to the hotel's upper floors, or try to reach higher ground on foot. You have 10 emergency items available.`,

                    Cell towers are down, and chaos is spreading in the streets below. The stairwells are packed with panicking people, and several have collapsed from heat and exhaustion. Water pressure is failing as pumping stations shut down.

Summer heat is turning the building into an oven, and you can see smoke rising from several parts of the city.
